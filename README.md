BridgeManagementHelper
======================

This is an android application that helps to to bridge engineers in their day to day duties


I developed this for Software Engineering Project course module of Semester 5 of Bs. Eng. Hons. degree which i follow at university of Moratuwa.

This was intended to work in 2.3 Gingerbread version of Android and may not work properly in newer devices.(Certainly not on my current phone- Android 4.3.2 Jelly Bean..not properly but some of the features are working)



This was not pushed to Github until today...23 rd march 2014

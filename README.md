SEP_project
===========

This is the Android Application project repo i built for the SEP course Module of university of Moratuwa

This is an android application that helps to to bridge engineers in their day to day duties

I developed this for Software Engineering Project course module of Semester 5 of Bs. Eng. Hons. 
degree which i follow at university of Moratuwa.

This was intended to work in 2.3 Gingerbread version of Android and may not work properly in newer devices.
(Certainly not on my current phone- Android 4.3.2 Jelly Bean..not properly but some of the features are working)


I pushed my last commits to this repo on 24th march 2014 6 months after the project
